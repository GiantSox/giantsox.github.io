# Underanalyzing

I’ve been considering adding analytics to this site, but I don’t think I will.

I am by no means anti-analytics, and making informed decisions based on user data has hugely helped guide the development of projects I’ve worked on. I have dreams of dumping more of my thoughts into essays to share here, and seeing which are most popular and how long people spend reading them could be very informative.

…but I don’t think that information would be healthy. My goal with this blog, if I ever end up using it as one, is to give me a place to share my thoughts with the world, on whatever topic I’m thinking about. Platforms like Instagram and Twitter provide plenty of gratification when a post captures people’s attention, but my goal here is not to please crowds, or worse, start controversy.

I would love for this to be a place that sparks intellectual discovery, not instant gratification. If something I write leads to just one person changing their view on a topic, or learning something that makes their life better in some small way, I’ve succeeded. If something I write leads to someone contacting me and having an enriching conversation where either of us learns something new, even better.

This really does not feel like a piece of writing worth sharing, but I want to nurture my writing habit, so I'm sharing it anyway. Hello, world!
