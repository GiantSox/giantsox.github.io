Why hello there! You have reached the personal website of David Goodman, or as most people seem to call me, "Sox". I'm still really not sure what I'm going to do with this site quite yet, but in the meantime, have a few bullet points about me:
- I do programmery things over at [LIV](http://liv.tv), where I'm currently working on our upcoming mobile app.
- I love all things virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
- I recently left school, to pursue what I believe will be a more complete education through work and self-learning.
- I was born and raised in San Francisco (by non-techie parents!), where I currently live with my family, and our Guatemalan rescue dog.
- I've got 20 years on my age counter.
- You can watch me awkwardly ramble about my work on camera [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOQ7CDKj4Rk).
